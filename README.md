# 📦 Sorting Boxes by Height – Factory IO Simulation

This project demonstrates an automated **box-sorting system** based on height using **Factory IO** and **Allen-Bradley’s Connected Components Workbench (CCW)** with a **Micro850 (2080-LC50)** PLC simulation.  
The setup replicates a real-world factory environment where boxes are identified and sorted into categories using industrial sensors and conveyor systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The system automates a **Sorting Boxes by Height** process within a virtual factory designed in **Factory IO**.  
PLC logic was developed in **CCW**, downloaded to a **virtual Micro850 PLC**, and connected to Factory IO for real-time control and simulation.

## 🏭 System Description

The system consists of **three conveyor belts** and a **box height detection mechanism**:

- **Entry Conveyor:**  
  Brings all incoming boxes to the detection zone.

- **Digital Light Array (Height Detection):**  
  Consists of four vertical light beams used to classify boxes:
  - **Small Boxes:** Break the bottom two beams.
  - **Large Boxes:** Break all four beams.

- **Chain Transfer Section:**  
  Transfers boxes from the entry conveyor to either the left or right conveyor.  
  A **capacitive sensor** detects the presence of a box before transfer.

- **Right Conveyor:**  
  Transports **large boxes**.

- **Left Conveyor:**  
  Transports **small boxes**.

Each conveyor includes:
- An **Entry Retroreflective Sensor** to detect when a box enters.  
- An **Exit Retroreflective Sensor** to stop the conveyor once the box exits.

The automation ensures that each box is sorted correctly based on its height.

## 🧠 Control Logic (CCW Ladder Diagram)

The **ladder logic** in Connected Components Workbench handles:
- Sensor signal interpretation.  
- Height classification using the digital light array.  
- Actuation of conveyors and chain transfer based on classification.  
- Box tracking and sequential control to prevent overlapping operations.
